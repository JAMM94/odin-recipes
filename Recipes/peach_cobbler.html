        <h4>Instrucctions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Unroll pie crust on a baking sheet and 
                drizzle with butter. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon brown sugar and cinnamon. 
                Bake for 10 minutes. Cut into strips and let cool.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the half and half, brown 
                sugar, white sugar, and salt. Stir until sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take saucepan off heat. Place eggs in a medium bowl. While whisking, 
                gradually (to not curdle the eggs) add about half the sugar/half-and-half 
                mixture to the eggs.</li>
            <li>Pour egg mixture into saucepan with the half and half that remained 
                in the saucepan.</li>
            <li>Stir in cream.</li>
            <li>Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until mixture thickens and 
                coats the back of a spoon. About 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take saucepan off heat and stir in vanilla extract and almond extract. 
                Pour mixture through a fine-meshed sieve into a bowl and let cool 
                to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Place 1 cup of peaches in food processor and process until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add processed peaches and chopped peaches to cream mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturers 
                directions.</li>
            <li>Just before turning ice cream maker off, add about 1/2 the pie crust 
                pieces, crumbling them into the ice cream.</li>
            <li>If ice cream is not thick enough for your liking, 
                place in freezer for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Serve with remaining pie crust pieces.</li>
